* Marvell EBU GPIO controller

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "marvell,orion-gpio", "marvell,mv78200-gpio"
  or "marvell,armadaxp-gpio". "marvell,orion-gpio" should be used for
  Orion, Kirkwood, Dove, Discovery (except MV78200), Armada 370, and
  Armada 7k&8k AP/CP. "marvell,mv78200-gpio" should be used for the
  Discovery MV78200. "marvel,armadaxp-gpio" should be used for all
  Armada XP SoCs (MV78230, MV78260, MV78460).

- reg: Address and length of the register sets for the device.
  - For "marvell,mv78200-gpio" compatible, one entry for the general registers;
  - For "marvell,armadaxp-gpio" compatible, two entries are expected:
    one for the general registers, one for the per-cpu registers.
  - For "marvell,orion-gpio" compatible, reg can be one entry or two entries:
    for Armada 7k&8k AP GPIO controllers, reg has two entries: one for the general
    registers, one for soc interrupt registers;
    for other controllers, reg has one entry for the general registers.

- interrupts: The list of interrupts that are used for all the pins
  managed by this GPIO bank. There can be more than one interrupt
  (example: 1 interrupt per 8 pins on Armada XP, which means 4
  interrupts per bank of 32 GPIOs).

- interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller

- #interrupt-cells: Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. Should be two.
  The first cell is the GPIO number.
  The second cell is used to specify flags:
    bits[3:0] trigger type and level flags:
      1 = low-to-high edge triggered.
      2 = high-to-low edge triggered.
      4 = active high level-sensitive.
      8 = active low level-sensitive.

- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller

- ngpios: Number of GPIOs this controller has

- #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number. The
  second cell is reserved for flags, unused at the moment.

Optional:
- gpiobase: The base of the GPIO bank, if not defined the base calculated by
  multiplying the bank ID number by MVEBU_MAX_GPIO_PER_BANK (32)
  This option used in Armada-8k SoC, because the GPIOs count is different between banks
  In Armada-70x0: AP-806 has 20 GPIOs and CP-110 has 63 GPIOs that split into 2 banks,
  The base of CP0 bank0 should be 20 (after AP-806 pins) the base of CP0 bank1 should be
  52 (after AP-806, and CP0 bank0 pins)

Example:

		gpio0: gpio@d0018100 {
			compatible = "marvell,armadaxp-gpio";
			reg = <0xd0018100 0x40>,
			    <0xd0018800 0x30>;
			ngpios = <32>;
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
			interrupt-controller;
			#interrupt-cells = <2>;
			interrupts = <16>, <17>, <18>, <19>;
		};
